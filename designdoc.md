##Overview

Gameplay would be an arena / twin stick shooter style game with RPG -- or roguelike -- elements in a science fiction setting.

The storyline would follow the descent from the upper levels from the landing platform, through living quarters, commercial districut, industrial district, mines, and so on, further and deeper down into the core of the planet / moon / celestial body it resides on. It would have a ruined science-fiction theme -- along the lines of System Shock 2 or Dead Space -- with recognisable environments that indicate habitation as opposed to generic sci-fi scenery.

The overall feel to the game would be a mixture of slight horror elements of the downfall and ruination of the space station, and fast-paced action that will be randomised and generated afresh each playthrough. Character persistence (with permadeath) is considered, but not yet decided. Upon completion, that character slot will still be marked as alive and a new game plus mode will be enabled with greater xp, enemies and loot to be gained.

Rather than jumping straight on the laser guns and futuristic weapons of traditional sci-fi, an approach is to be taken to use updated or modern versions of traditional weapons such as swords, bows, crossbows, and so on, giving equal importance to either melee or ranged combat.

##Target platform

Aiming for release on all major desktop operating systems. Primarily being developed with Windows and Linux in mind, OSX release likely.

##Visual style

Aiming for a style along the lines of System Shock 2 or Dead Space. Not necessarily cutting edge graphics techniques (framerate and performance is above all), but not adopting a lo-fi or retro look. Levels will have a theme for each floor (as mentioned in the overview, accommodation, commercial, industrial, mining, and so on) and unique room types / layouts for each, getting progressively larger as progress is made.

The idea is to give the environments the feeling that they were once lived in and the creatures and enemies which now exist had resistance to their takeover of the station. The environments should show heavy signs of wear and battles that have passed.

##Audio style

Following with the name of the game, Crust, the music will be along the lines of crust punk / grind, though without vocals as not to be too abrasive to the end user. Possible use of music keys based on action. Such as ambient music when not "in combat", and fast-paced punk music when fighting.
